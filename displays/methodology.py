        1. **Significance of Sentiment Coefficient ($\beta$)**:

            - **Copper**: Shows a statistically significant positive relationship with sentiment ($p = 0.0228$), indicating that increased bullish sentiment is associated with higher returns.
            - **Oil**: Also exhibits a significant positive relationship ($p = 0.0480$).
            - **Aluminium**: Approaches significance at the 10% level ($p = 0.0866$).
            - **Other Commodities**: Gold, gas, sugar, and wheat do not show significant relationships, as indicated by their high p-values.

        2. **Direction of Impact**:

            - **Positive Coefficients**: Most commodities have positive $\beta$ coefficients, suggesting that bullish sentiment tends to correlate with higher returns.
            - **Negative Coefficients**: Gold and wheat have slightly negative coefficients, implying a minor inverse relationship with sentiment, which may reflect their roles as safe-haven assets.

        3. **Goodness of Fit ($R^2$)**:

            - The $R^2$ values are low for all commodities, indicating that sentiment explains a small portion of the variance in returns.
            - This suggests that while sentiment has some impact, other factors play significant roles in determining commodity returns.

        Overall, the regression analysis reveals that investor sentiment has a statistically significant impact on certain commodities, particularly *copper* and *oil*. However, the low $R^2$ values highlight the complexity of commodity markets and the influence of additional factors such as supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, and macroeconomic indicators.

            - The formula determines the optimal allocation to risky assets based on the trade-off between expected return and risk, scaled by the investor's risk aversion. 

        3. **Adjust for Constraints**: 

            - The allocation is bounded between 0 and 1 to ensure practical feasibility (no borrowing or short-selling of the risk-free asset). 

        **Final Portfolio Composition**: 

        - **Risky Assets**: The weights $\mathbf{w}$ are scaled by $w_{\text{risky}}$.
